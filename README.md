# 🎧 Biplove Poudel – Audio Technologist in Progress

Hello! I'm Biplove Poudel — a passionate music producer and aspiring audio test engineer currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Music at Weber State University. Originally from Nepal 🇳🇵, I'm now based in Ogden, Utah 🇺🇸 and deeply interested in the intersection of audio, technology, and creativity.

🎼 What I Do

- 🎹 Produce music using Logic Pro X, FL Studio, and Adobe Audition  
- 🛠️ Learn Python and C++ to build tools and scripts for audio testing  
- 🧪 Experiment with audio drivers, wave file analysis, and DAW automation  
- 🔊 Train my ears for detecting audio anomalies and sound quality issues  
- 🧑‍🎓 Study audio theory, signal flow, and machine-level processing  
- 📚 Exploring how creativity meets engineering — and aiming for roles at companies like Apple

🎯 Current Goals

- Build Python tools to analyze audio files and simulate QA workflows  
- Learn basic DSP (Digital Signal Processing) and real-time audio concepts  
- Contribute to open-source projects related to music/audio tech  
- Apply for internships and future roles in audio QA/testing
